	In order to update this theme you must update the branch assigned to you and submit a pull 
	request for merger to the master branch.

	If you add or remove things from the theme please update this document along with your pull requests as well
	as changing the version number in the thrid decimal place above and in the style.css file.

	Versioning: 1.0.0 
		A. the first number is for a major release change. This might be like an overhaul; ex: 2.0.0
		B. the second number is for versions with a few to several feature updates; ex: 2.1.0
		C. the thrid number is for bug fixes, templates changes, etc...; ex: 2.1.1. This number will change more 
			frequent as it will indicate a merge with the master branch.

		When there are nine merges to the master branch, 
		this would indicate a shift of the second number; ex: 2.1.9 to 2.2.0

	When updating this document, please be sure to put your comments inside doc blocks such as the one which
	these comments are contained within and sign and date your comments so future devs can ask you questions about your
	contributions.

	***Please keep your comments readable and have some fun; you get to write code! Thank you!***
